# TASK13-POWER-BI-DASHBOARD-KPI-REPORT
Step 1: I took a retail sales raw dataset and began preparing measures for Sales, Profit, and Margin.
Step 2:  created KPI cards to display Sales, Profit, and Margin values at the top of the dashboard.
Step 3: I added a trend chart (Sales over time) to visualize daily fluctuations and seasonal peaks.
Step 4: I built a category breakdown bar chart to compare Sales across Electronics, Clothing, and Beauty.
Step 5: Since region data wasn’t available, I substituted with a Gender breakdown chart to show male vs female sales.
Step 6: Then inserted a Top Products table, sorted by Sales, to highlight the leading categories/products.
Step 7: Also added slicers for Date and Product Category (with placeholders for Region if data becomes available).
Step 8: I placed an “Insights” text box summarizing three key findings from the dashboard visuals.
Step 9: I exported the dashboard to PDF to share and preserve the complete report.
