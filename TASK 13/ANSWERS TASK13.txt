- What makes a dashboard effective?
I say a dashboard is effective when it is simple, focused on the right metrics, and tells a clear story without clutter.
- KPI meaning and examples?
I call KPIs “Key Performance Indicators,” like Sales, Profit, or Customer Retention, because they measure success against business goals.
- Drill‑down vs filter?
I explain drill‑down as clicking deeper into a chart to see details (Year → Quarter → Month), while filters are manual selections that change what all visuals display.
- How to avoid misleading visuals?
I remind myself to use proper scales, avoid cherry‑picking time ranges, and keep labels clear so the audience doesn’t misinterpret the data.
- How to validate dashboard totals?
I always cross‑check totals with the raw dataset or source system, ensuring that aggregations and measures match the original numbers.
